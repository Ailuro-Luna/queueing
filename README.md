# Stochastic Simulation: Assignment 2 - Discrete Event Simulation with Multiple Queues and Servers

## Overview
This project is part of the Stochastic Simulation course (5284STSI6Y) and focuses on implementing a Discrete Event Simulation (DES) with multiple queues and multiple servers. The goal is to explore the waiting times in different queue configurations.

## Usage

### Running the Simulation
The notebook includes several sections to set up and run the DES models. Execute each cell in sequence to run the simulations and view the results.

### Analysis
The simulation results are analyzed using various statistical tools and visualizations implemented in Python. Key sections include:

- Importing necessary packages
- Setting up the simulation environment
- Running the DES models
- Collecting and analyzing simulation data

## Features
- Implementation of multiple queues and servers in a DES model.
- Statistical analysis of waiting times in different configurations.
- Visualization of results using plots and charts.
